# Stables Isotope Analysis for Lake Trout in a Multibasin Lake.

Code and data for manuscript focused on how the size and availability of
thermal habitats drives differences in habitat use and thus affecting
what food is available for a Lake Trout to consume or at least the types
of food items a fish consumes. Changes in food availability and food
consumed can affect the trophic position of a Lake Trout. Growth rates
of Lake Trout could be affected by differences in trophic position
caused by thermal habitat use, and thus affecting the fitness of a Lake
Trout in our study system.
